Catholic and Manichean Way of Life）一书中，说出了他对修道主义的观点。所以，他回到非洲后，就以身作则，在塔迦斯特（Thagaste），成立一所修道院。初期，这所修道院的修道士，都是平信徒，修道主义（The Monasticism）只是一种平信徒运动（laymovement）。这类由奥古斯丁的亲友组成的平信徒修道生活，是西方修道运动的基石，而他们所遵循的生活规则，在《圣奥古斯丁的规则》（Rule of St.Angustine）中，曾作了详尽的说明。

Ⅵ）因着获得波希米亚（Bohemia）各地罗马教徒的支持，就希望也争取到英国的罗马教徒的支持，来携手对抗坐镇于法国亚威农的教皇革利免七世（Clement Ⅶ）。乌尔班六世为此就促成了年仅十六岁的波希米亚的安妮公主（Princess Anne）和英王理查二世（Richard Ⅱ）于一三八二年结婚。安妮皇后是一位敬虔爱主的姐妹，她特别喜欢阅读威克里夫英译本圣经中的四福音。安妮皇后的父亲即是神圣罗马帝国（Holy Roman Empire）的皇帝查理士四世（Charles IV），而她的哥哥则是当时波希米亚的皇帝。安妮皇后下嫁英王理查二世时，理查二世才十五岁，比她小一岁。在安妮的影响下，在他们结婚后的十二年间，许多波希米亚的学生到牛津大学留学，有的也就成为威克里夫的学生。这些学生学成后，把威克里夫的著作、讲稿和英译本圣经带回波希米亚。在牛津大学的学生中，最衷心信服威克里夫的，是一个来自布拉格（Prague）的耶柔米（Jerome）。这个学生耶柔米，回到波希米亚的布拉格后，就火热地传讲他在牛津大学从威克里夫所领受的真理。他在布拉格指责罗马教已经堕落，已经背离基督的教训。耶柔米并指出，任何人只能从神那里得着救恩。许多人听了深受感动，内中有布拉格的神学博士约翰•胡斯（John Huss）。约翰•胡斯很快地将威克里夫的著作翻译成波希米亚文。 \"),_c('br'),_c('br'),_vm._v(\"一四一五年七月六日，罗马教在巴伐利亚（Bavaria）举行的康士坦斯会议（Council of Constance）上，把约翰•胡斯判处火刑。判决书中所罗列的约翰•胡斯的罪名如下：

Avon），接着他的骨灰从阿邦河注入色文河（River Severn），再由色文河流到近海，然后汇入各大洋。威克里夫的骨灰，不啻是他的事工和信息的象征，也正如他的圣经的普及工作和他的纯正信仰一样，从此辗转扩散到世界各地。”\"),_c('br'),_c('br'),_vm._v(\"约翰•胡斯逝世之后，追随他的人，包括了波希米亚的弟兄们和摩拉维亚（Moravia）的合一弟兄会（The United

Martyrs）之后，这本世界闻名的属灵经典著作，把威克里夫和罗拉德派的血迹史公诸于世，让其辉煌事迹，辗转相传，历代不衰，长达四百四十年。约翰•福克斯的挚友德拉克爵士（Sir Francis Drake）在横渡大西洋，前往美洲新大陆时，手持《殉道者血迹史》，在船上当众高声朗诵威克里夫和罗拉德派的感人事迹。从此，威克里夫的献身精神和舍己为人的高贵品格，鼓励了大西洋彼岸成千上万的基督徒。

\"),_c('br'),_c('br'),_vm._v(\"　　于是路德谦卑的回答，他并不高声喊叫，也不激烈陈词，只是慎重温和的述说，语气带着喜乐和坚定。『至尊皇帝和诸位显要，我遵照昨日命令站立皇前，因神的诸般恩慈，我恳请你们垂听辩护，因我确信这是正义。若我无知触犯朝廷礼仪，尚祈见宥，因我并非生长帝王宫中，反养育在幽僻的修院内。昨日所询两问，首问我已答复，而且维持原议。至于第二问：我所写的，涉及不同题目。有些论到信心和善行，内容纯洁，合乎圣经，即使我的仇敌也无法非难，反而承认这些著作相当有益，值得虔诚人的阅读。教皇的训谕，纵然言辞猛烈，也承认这点。因此我若撤回这些，我成了何种人？……可怜的人！在人类中，我竟独自放弃友仇共赞的真理，以致反对了全世界所引以为荣的。第二，我也写着非难教廷，我攻击那些用假道理、败坏生活、或恶榜样，扰害基督教的世界，而且毁损身体与灵魂的人。凡敬畏神的人，都有同感，都能印证这事。教皇的法律，与人为的道理，岂不缠累骚扰信徒的良心？罗马的喊叫，和不断的勒索，岂不吞灭了基督教世界的财富？尤其剥夺了这个显要国家的富源！这些都有确实无误的证据。我若撤回这些，岂非助桀为虐，拔去水闸，任由不敬不虔泛滥地面么？如此，则狂浪势将激起，傲慢人必然加增，霸道更加横行压在基督徒身上的重轭，将因我的撤回，越发加重，而且也因着这个撤回，显为合法，得着至尊皇帝和神圣帝国诸参赞的批准。慈仁的神啊！这样我将变成一件凶袍掩蔽各种险恶残害！……最后，我会著书，反对那些维护罗马霸道，并毁损信心的人。我坦白承认，或者对待他们过于严厉，超越了我的身分。我否认自己是圣人；然而我不能取消这些著作，因为如果这样，我岂不称许仇敌的不虔，使他们趁机，加倍压迫神的百姓么？』

皇廷发言人勃然大怒说：『你尚未答复所问。你被传非为辩论教法会议的决议，乃为简洁答复所问。你是否撤回？』路德毫无踌躇的答说：『你们既然要我简洁答复，我的答复在此：我不能把我的信心，置于教皇，或教法会议之下，因为他们时常错误，而且彼此矛盾，似画之明，无容讳言。所以除非用圣经的见证，或清楚的悟性说服我，除非我被所引的经节感化，以致我的良心受到神的话语约束，我不能也不愿撤回，因为基督徒违反良心说话，是不稳当的』他就目光四射，遍视会众，--他的生命执在他们手中，--说：『我坚持，我不能偏离左右；因神帮助我！阿们！』

会众大为吃惊，很多侯卿无法掩饰他们的钦佩。皇帝惊定后，喊说：『这个修士说话胆大气壮。』西班牙和意大利人，起先感觉迷惘，后来往往嘲笑他们所不了解的伟大。发言人就说：『你若不撤回，皇帝和帝国参赞将会商如何处置怙恶不悛的异端者。』路德的朋友都开始震慄，然而路德重复说：『愿神作我的帮助；因为我不能撤回任何一点。』此后他被引退，侯卿们开始议论。大家感觉这是基督教国的重要关头。这个修士的『是』，与『否』，可能决定教会和世界数世纪的命运。他的仇敌欲恐吓他，结果反而高抬了他。他们想广布他的失败，反而增荣他的胜利。罗马党徒不甘屈服。因此重召路德入内，发言人又说：『马丁，你说话并未持守身分。关于你著作的分类实属无益；因为你只要撤回含有错误的书籍，皇帝就不容其余付炬。你恢复康士坦丁会议（General Counsel of Constance）所定罪的异端，竟要求用圣经反驳，实太放肆。因此皇帝要你爽直答复，是或否到底欲维持原议，或者部分撤回？』路德安静的答说：『除了业经答复的，我并无其他意见。』他的意思是清楚的。人海冲激他，他如巨石屹立不动。他的话语有力、他的态度勇敢、他的目光尖锐、他的容貌坚定，这些都留下深刻的印象。妥协的希望已经消失。修士已经征服世上的巨头。他已经说了『不』。查理五世站起来，全体起立。发言人宣称：『会议明日继续举行，听候皇帝判词。』

次日皇帝在会议中，命令宣读他亲手起草的文件『我决意效法祖先，他们都以护卫罗马信仰著称。一个修士，放荡淫佚，胆敢反抗基督教国信仰。为着阻止这种不虔，我不惜牺牲帝国、财宝、朋友、身体、血液、灵魂和生命。我将遣散这个奥古斯丁派的路德，禁止他骚扰百姓；然后我要以顽固异端者的罪名，对付他和他的从者，用革除、禁令和其他方式毁灭他们。我嘱咐国内诸侯遵照教规而行。』这个文件并不取悦众人，因为查理年轻草率，未照常规先征求大会意见，立刻发生两种意见：教皇派主张不必尊重安全证，另外的人坚持不可失信。衡量各种因素后，皇帝决定遵守诺言，并在三日后下令路德出境，限在二十一天内返乡，沿途不得传道或写作，扰乱治安。

路德清楚看见，这不过是定罪的开始。他温柔的答说：『主若愿意，但愿主名得称赞！』又加上说：『我要首先诚心感激皇上、选帝侯、诸侯、和帝国参赞，垂听我的申诉。我愿意，也只愿一件事，就是教会照着圣经有所改革。我准备降服皇上旨意，忍受一切。生或死，美名或恶名，这些对我并无不同。我只保留一件事，即传福音，因为保罗说过：「然而神的道却不被捆绑。」』

四月二十六日，周五早晨，路德的朋友聚集在旅馆内。他们都因他的坚定而欢喜，愿意与他作可能是最后一次的再会。他们一同聚餐。路德愿意在这严肃时刻，进到神面前去。他倾心祷告，求神祝福那些与他同站的人。钟鸣十下，他和同来沃姆斯的朋友离开旅馆，在群众拥挤之中出城而去。这样他逃出了沃姆斯城墙，他的葬身之地。他全心归荣耀于神。并说：『魔鬼亲自防卫教皇、城堡，但是基督开辟一条大道，使撒但不得不承认主比牠更有能力。』
